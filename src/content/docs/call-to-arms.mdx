description: A call to arms for TypeScript developers
---

:::note[Too Long, Didn't Read]

[Radashi](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi) is a new TypeScript-first utility library focused on minimalism, customizability, and a strong community focus. It's still in its early stages, which means it needs your support more than ever. By [giving us a star](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi) on GitHub, you're not just showing your appreciation; you're actively contributing to healthy competition in the utility library space.

**“Show me the functions!”** Sure thing, you'll want [this page.](/reference)

:::

Utility libraries are essential for efficient programming, allowing developers to avoid rewriting common functions. However, in our rapidly evolving JavaScript landscape, we face several challenges with existing solutions.

Traditional utility libraries, though useful, often suffer from centralized control, leading to friction in implementing incremental improvements. This centralization can stifle innovation and limit the ability of the community to contribute effectively. Moreover, keeping pace with changes in syntax and tooling can be a struggle for these established libraries.

Another significant issue is the lack of customizability. Developers often find themselves using only a fraction of a library's functions, yet are forced to include the entire package, leading to unnecessary bloat in their projects. The ability to cherry-pick only the needed functions without hassle remains an unmet need.

Furthermore, the JavaScript community lacks a unified platform for sharing and adopting utility functions. Developers frequently reinvent the wheel, writing similar functions across different projects, when a shared resource could save time and promote best practices.

Imagine a world where these problems are solved. Picture a large community of TypeScript developers gathering around a single web page to share their utility functions. In this ideal scenario, all functions are written with the same design guidelines, ensuring consistency and quality. Developers can effortlessly copy these functions into their own curated set of utilities, tailoring their toolkit to their specific needs without unnecessary overhead.

This vision represents a decentralized, collaborative ecosystem where your contributions can be seamlessly adopted by others, and vice versa. It's a world where a shared design ethos and common tooling setup reduce barriers to continuous enhancement, fostering a thriving community eager to expand each other's JavaScript toolkits.

In this imagined future, there's no need for approval from a random maintainer to share or adopt a useful function. Instead, the community itself becomes the curator, with popular and well-designed functions rising to the top through collective use and improvement.

This is the future of utility libraries we should strive for - one that addresses the shortcomings of its predecessors while embracing the power of community collaboration and individual customization.

### Wait... what is Radashi?

First and foremost, Radashi is a **TypeScript-first utility library** with the twist of easy customizability and a strong design ethos. You don't want to miss out on this, trust me.

Radashi is **bigger than any one person**. It's a community effort to build a solid foundation for all of us to share our own TypeScript utility functions through (more on this later).

But as a library, Radashi stands out with its:

- **Principled design**
- **Minimal bundle impact**
- **Pragmatism** (popular use cases, an approachable number of functions)
- **Customizability**
- **A strong community focus**

It builds on three years of active development from its now dormant predecessor, Radash, which has become the fastest-growing Lodash alternative with **over 100K weekly downloads**.

Radashi is set to become a solid foundation for all of us to gather around, like [a town square](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi/pulls), efficiently sharing our TypeScript utility functions, all while practicing adherence to **the Radashi ethos**. For this to happen, **we need your help**, so let's see if I can't persuade you to join us.

## What Matters

#### Design with Purpose

Every great library is underpinned by a set of design principles. For Radashi, these principles are encapsulated in our **living** document, [“Our Ethos”](/our-ethos), which guides our decision-making processes. This document is crucial for maintaining **high standards** while welcoming contributions from **a diverse community**. Anyone can suggest changes to this document, allowing our ethos to evolve alongside our community's needs.

#### Trimming the Fat

When discussing JavaScript utility libraries, Lodash is often the benchmark. However, Lodash's flexibility (achieved through polymorphism) and legacy browser support often comes at the cost of simplicity, leading to **larger bundle sizes** and **hard-to-read** code.

Radashi embraces a **minimalist design** philosophy, focusing on essential functionality without resorting to convoluted code optimizations. Even if Radashi is **not strictly minimalist**, it still greatly influences our design and review processes. This ensures our library remains lightweight, efficient, and easy to customize.

#### Pragmatism First

Pragmatism is a key principle in Radashi's approach. We focus on supporting **popular use cases** while keeping our API manageable. This means we include functions that are widely useful, rather than trying to cover every possible scenario. Our goal is to strike **a balance between functionality and simplicity**.

By limiting the number of functions to those most commonly needed, we prevent the API from becoming overwhelming in size. This ensures that Radashi remains focused and efficient, providing developers with essential utilities without unnecessary complexity.

However, we also recognize the power of **community demand**. If a particular function gains significant popularity and support from our users, we're open to including it. After all, in the end, democracy wins - if the community wants a function badly enough, we'll listen and probably add it to the official Radashi.

#### Your Vision, Our Canvas

Traditional utility libraries are often challenging to customize, with maintaining a fork being more trouble than it's worth due to outdated syntax or unfamiliar codebases. Radashi addresses this issue with its own [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) on GitHub.

This template allows you to extend Radashi with new functions or even forked functions, enabling you to publish your custom Radashi package to NPM seamlessly. Your additions and changes are published alongside official Radashi functions, but your functions are kept separate from ours, making the repository easier to navigate.

The template repository automatically keeps your fork synchronized with the main Radashi repository, based on the `radashi` version specified in `package.json`.

To experience this customizability firsthand (recommended), [follow this guide](/your-own-radashi) to create your own Radashi. Start building upon Radashi the easy way.

#### Strength in Numbers

Putting the community's needs first is a core aspect of Radashi's ethos. This commitment manifests in our focus on customizability and openness to new ideas and perspectives.

Radashi publishes a beta version daily at 05:00 AM UTC if a PR has been merged into the `main` branch. Using our template repository, you can access PRs even sooner with the `pnpm pr import 123` command.

Anyone can become a maintainer by applying [here](https://github.com/orgs/radashi-org/discussions/4). As a maintainer, you're expected to uphold the Radashi ethos, and with dedication, you may become a Radashi steward, granting you the ability to veto PRs and publish stable versions to NPM. Come join us, we're always looking to expand the core team!

### Is Radashi Your Perfect Match?
