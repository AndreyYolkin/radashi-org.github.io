<summary>Too Long, Didn't Read</summary>

The ecosystem of utility functions is needlessly fragmented, stifled by a lack of collaboration and standardization. Popular utility libraries are under-maintained and/or have a centralized authority. We need a utility library that is structured to foster collaboration and innovation.

Imagine a world where TypeScript developers can effortlessly share their utility functions with each other. This is the vision of Radashi.

[Radashi](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi) is a new TypeScript-first utility library focused on minimalism, customizability, and a strong ethos. But it's more than that. It's also a growing community of like-minded TypeScript developers who are passionate about sharing useful functions with each other (no gatekeepers).

It's still in its early stages, which means it needs your support more than ever. By [giving us a star](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi) on GitHub, you're not just showing your appreciation; you're actively contributing to healthy competition in the utility library space.

Utility libraries are essential for efficient programming, preventing the need to rewrite common functions. However, in the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem, existing solutions now face several challenges. By the end of this post, my hope is that you'll not only see the problem, but also see a solution. So what challenges are we facing?

##### Bottleneck Control

Traditional utility libraries often suffer from **centralized control**, hindering incremental improvements and community contributions. This often leads to maintainer burnout, which makes the problem worse. Migrating to modern syntax and tooling has been a low priority for established libraries.

##### Stifled Customization

A significant issue is the **lack of customizability**. Developers often want to supplement a popular utility library with their own functions or replacements but encounter friction in doing so. This limitation slows down innovation and collaboration.

##### Ecosystem Chaos

Furthermore, the JavaScript community lacks a **unified platform** for sharing and adopting utility functions, leading to **unnecessary fragmentation** of the ecosystem. Developers often reinvent the wheel across different projects when a shared resource could save time and promote best practices.

##### Imagine This...

Imagine a world where these problems are solved: a large community of TypeScript developers sharing utility functions around one foundation. All functions follow the same design guidelines, ensuring **consistency and quality**. Developers can **effortlessly copy and customize** these functions, tailoring their toolkit without unnecessary overhead.

This vision represents a decentralized, collaborative ecosystem where contributions are seamlessly adopted by others, all while **reducing risk exposure by not depending on self-interested maintainers**. It fosters a thriving community eager to expand each other's JavaScript toolkits, with popular and well-designed functions rising to the top through collective use and improvement.

This is the future of utility libraries we should strive for ‚Äî one that addresses the shortcomings of its predecessors while embracing the power of community collaboration and individual customization.

And that's where **Radashi** enters the picture.

### Wait... what is Radashi?

First and foremost, Radashi is a **TypeScript-first utility library** with the twist of easy customizability and a strong design ethos. You don't want to miss out on this, trust me.

Radashi is **bigger than any one person**. It's a community effort to build a solid foundation for all of us to share our own TypeScript utility functions through (more on this later).

But as a library, Radashi stands out with its:

- **Principled design**
- **Minimal bundle impact**
- **Innovative functions**
- **Pragmatism** (popular use cases, an approachable number of functions)
- **Customizability**
- **A strong community focus**

It builds on three years of active development from its now dormant predecessor, Radash, which has become the fastest-growing Lodash alternative with **over 100K weekly downloads**.

Radashi is set to become **a solid foundation** for all of us to gather around, like a town square, efficiently sharing our TypeScript utility functions, while we embrace **the Radashi ethos**. For this to happen, **we need your help**, so let's see if I can't persuade you to join us.

## Our Principles

#### Design with Purpose

Every great library is underpinned by a set of design principles. For Radashi, these principles are encapsulated in our **living** document, [‚ÄúOur Ethos‚Äù](/our-ethos), which guides our decision-making processes. This document is crucial for maintaining **high standards** while welcoming contributions from **a diverse community**. Anyone can suggest changes to this document, allowing our ethos to evolve alongside our community's needs.

#### Trimming the Fat

When discussing JavaScript utility libraries, Lodash is often the benchmark. However, Lodash's flexibility (achieved through polymorphism) and legacy browser support often comes at the cost of simplicity, leading to **larger bundle sizes** and **hard-to-read** code.

Radashi embraces a **minimalist design** philosophy, focusing on essential functionality without resorting to convoluted code optimizations. Even if Radashi is **not strictly minimalist**, it still greatly influences our design and review processes. This ensures our library remains lightweight, efficient, and easy to customize.

#### Pragmatism First

Pragmatism is a key principle in Radashi's approach. We focus on supporting **popular use cases** while keeping our API manageable. This means we include functions that are widely useful, rather than trying to cover every possible scenario. Our goal is to strike **a balance between functionality and simplicity**.

By limiting the number of functions to those most commonly needed, we prevent the API from becoming overwhelming in size. This ensures that Radashi remains focused and efficient, providing developers with essential utilities without unnecessary complexity.

However, we also recognize the power of **community demand**. If a particular function gains significant popularity and support from our users, we're open to including it. After all, in the end, democracy wins - if the community wants a function badly enough, we'll listen and probably add it to the official Radashi.

#### Blazing New Trails

Radashi is a trailblazer in the JavaScript ecosystem, anticipating developers' evolving needs and addressing emerging challenges in modern JavaScript and TypeScript. We're not afraid to **challenge conventions** and explore uncharted territory.

You'll find unique, widely applicable functions in Radashi that you won't see elsewhere. We constantly seek fresh approaches to common problems, fostering innovation that shapes JavaScript's evolution.

This forward-thinking approach keeps Radashi at the cutting edge, providing developers with essential tools they didn't know they needed. By pushing boundaries, we're redefining what a utility library can be in the modern JavaScript landscape.

#### Your Vision, Our Canvas

Traditional utility libraries are often challenging to customize, with maintaining a fork being more trouble than it's worth due to outdated syntax or unfamiliar codebases. Radashi addresses this issue with its own [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) on GitHub.

This template allows you to extend Radashi with new functions or even forked functions, enabling you to publish your custom Radashi package to NPM seamlessly. Your additions and changes are published alongside official Radashi functions, but your functions are kept separate from ours, making the repository easier to navigate.

The template repository automatically keeps your fork synchronized with the main Radashi repository, based on the `radashi` version specified in `package.json`.

To experience this customizability firsthand (recommended), [follow this guide](/your-own-radashi) to create your own Radashi. Start building upon Radashi the easy way.

#### Strength in Numbers

Putting the community's needs first is a core aspect of Radashi's ethos. This commitment manifests in our focus on customizability and openness to new ideas and perspectives.

Radashi publishes a beta version daily at 05:00 AM UTC if a PR has been merged into the `main` branch. Using our template repository, you can access PRs even sooner with the `pnpm pr import 123` command.

Anyone can become a maintainer by applying [here](https://github.com/orgs/radashi-org/discussions/4). As a maintainer, you're expected to uphold the Radashi ethos, and with dedication, you may become a Radashi steward, granting you the ability to veto PRs and publish stable versions to NPM. Come join us, we're always looking to expand the core team!
