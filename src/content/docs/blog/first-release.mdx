<summary>Too Long, Didn't Read</summary>

We're forking Radash, a modern TypeScript utility library with 100K+ weekly downloads and 4K stars on GitHub, which is sadly unmaintained. We want your support to help Radashi reach its full potential of a decentralized, community-driven utility library. Read on to learn more about Radashi's vision.

Radashi wants to be your new favorite utility library for TypeScript. Instead of taking the safe route of rewriting Lodash into a modern library like others have done, Radashi builds on **~3 years of development** by its predecessor (Radash), which dares to rethink what a utility library for TypeScript should be.

As we all know, Lodash is a great library, but its age is showing. Not just in terms of the codebase, but also the mindset. We loved Lodash for its pragmatic approach to (what once was) idiomatic JavaScript. Unfortunately, Lodash's complexity has cost it a sustainable future that allows it to keep up with the pace of modern JavaScript. It's more than that, though. Lodash is built with **an outdated mindset** that caters to a shrinking audience – developers who want a toolkit that “just works” and who don't care if it's bloated or hard to modify.

Radashi has a big vision, one bigger than its predecessor's vision of a modern library. Radashi's not just a library. It's a community of like-minded TypeScript developers that **doesn't revolve around a single person**. Radashi adopts a newer mindset, one with design principles that are explicitly defined in a living document, **Our Ethos** (more on this in a later post).

At Radashi, we believe that **there is no “one size fits all”** when it comes to utility libraries. But that doesn't mean we, as a community, should be fragmented in our efforts. Using the Radashi ethos as our common ground, a new layer of collaboration is born. Radashi aims to be **a solid foundation** for you to customize and extend to your heart's content. We've discovered that if we all organize our utility libraries in the same way, we can optimize shareability and collaboration.

**Radashi is a utility library with no gate-keeper.** There are stewards, like myself, who help keep the library aligned with the Radashi ethos, but the community ultimately decides the direction of the library. One way of doing that is by proposing changes to the ethos itself. Another way is through Radashi's pull requests page on GitHub, which acts as a town square for lightly-moderated sharing of functions that adhere to the Radashi ethos.

Even if a PR is never merged, you can still use it in _your own Radashi_ (no forking necessary). To accomplish this, **I'm developing some tools for every user of Radashi** which will let you easily import PRs into your own Radashi, so you don't have to wait for the Radashi team to merge a PR or approve of it. These tools will also empower you to easily extend Radashi without the hassle of keeping a local clone “in sync” with Radashi's official `main` branch (with merge conflicts being more rare). These tools include a command-line tool, a template repository, and even a VSCode extension, all of which are almost ready for showtime.

If this sounds like a promising vision, we need you to show your support by starring Radashi on GitHub. Even better, **contribute to Radashi** by opening issues, sending PRs, or participating in GitHub discussions. We are nearing the release of v13.0.0, so now is the perfect time to get involved.

There's so much more to say about Radashi, so I'll be writing more posts about it in the future. For now, I've collected some links for your convenience:
