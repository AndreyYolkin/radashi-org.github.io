Welcome to Radashi! We're here to make your development life easier with a collection of super handy functions designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript developers. Think of Radashi as a friendly toolbelt that‚Äôs all about simplicity, customization, and community.

## Key Features

#### ‚ú® Built for TypeScript

Radashi is made with TypeScript at its core. This means our functions not only help you write better code but also catch errors early, making your development smoother and more reliable.

import { TabbedCodeBlock } from '../../components/tabbed-code-block'

<TabbedCodeBlock names={['select', 'sum']} client:load>

```ts
import { select } from 'radashi'

// Example: Filtering and transforming a list of products
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', price: 1000, inStock: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'Phone', price: 800, inStock: false },
  { id: 3, name: 'Tablet', price: 500, inStock: true },
  { id: 4, name: 'Headphones', price: 100, inStock: true },
]

const affordableInStockProducts = select(
  products,
  product => ({ name: product.name, price: product.price }),
  product => product.inStock && product.price < 600
)
// => [{ name: 'Tablet', price: 500 }, { name: 'Headphones', price: 100 }]
```

```ts
import { sum } from 'radashi'

// Example: Sum the ages of all users
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 },
]

const totalAge = sum(users, user => user.age)
// => 90
```

</TabbedCodeBlock>

#### üéØ Smart Function Choices

We pick our functions based on real needs and popular use cases. Our goal is to give you just what you need without the extra fluff, keeping everything straightforward and useful.
